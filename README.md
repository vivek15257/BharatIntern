The code  is a straightforward implementation of a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn. Here's a breakdown of what is happening and how to interpret the results:

Libraries and Data Import:-

matplotlib.pyplot: Not used here but typically for visualization.
LinearRegression, train_test_split: Used for building and evaluating the regression model.
pandas: Used for data manipulation.
The dataset (homeprices.csv) contains features like area, bedrooms, age, and price.
Data Preprocessing:

df.dropna(inplace=True): Removes rows with missing values. This ensures the model works without encountering errors due to NaN values.
Features (x) and target (y) are separated:
x: All columns except price.
y: The price column (target).

Train-Test Split:
train_test_split(x, y, train_size=0.7, random_state=42): Splits the data into 70% training and 30% testing subsets.

Model Training:
LinearRegression().fit(x_train, y_train): Fits the model to the training data.

Model Evaluation:
rgr.score(x_test, y_test): Returns the coefficient of determination (ùëÖ2) on the test set. Here, the score is approximately 0.851, indicating that ~85.1% of the variance in price is explained by the model.
